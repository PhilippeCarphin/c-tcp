#+TITLE: Network programming in C

Following [[https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/index.html][Beej's Guide to Network Programming]]

First part was following the section [[https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/system-calls-or-bust.html#getaddrinfoprepare-to-launch][5.1 System Calls or Bust: =getaddrinfo()=]]
where I created do what he showed but did it in functions that I will be able
to reuse in later parts.

After that I did a server which I fed data to using the =nc= command.

I had it all working then the next day, I tried sending data to it from my
raspberry pi and I couldn't figure out why the connection was not closing
since I was sure I had handled that with =if(nbread == 0)=.  It turns out
that the =nc= command on =RaspberryPiOS= needs the =-N= flag to tell it to
close its side of the connection when it reaches the end of its input!
